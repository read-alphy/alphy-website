    question: "What is Alphy?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Alphy is a set of AI tools designed to help users interact with
        online and offline audiovisual content as easily and effectively
        as possible.
        <br/><br/>
        We use AI to transcribe, summarize, question, and let users
        create new written content on top of videos and
        recordings.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How does Alphy work?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Upon submitting a link or uploading a recording, Alphy creates the
        transcription, summary, key takeaways, and a mini AI assistant for
        the content.
        <br /><br />
        Then you can combine these content to create your AI-assisted
        search engines as effortlessly as building a playlist (we call
        them Arcs) that will answer your questions based on the corpus of
        content you have curated.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What kind of content can I use Alphy with?",
    answer: (
      <>
        You can use Alphy on YouTube
        videos, Twitter / X Spaces, Twitter / X videos, Twitch recordings,
        Apple Podcasts, and your local audio files (.mp3, .m4a, .mpga,
        .mpeg, .wav, or .webm).
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Can I upload local audio files for processing?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. When you upload files to Alphy, we handle them the same way
        as we do with your online submissions. The key difference is that
        your uploads are kept private, ensuring they remain accessible
        only to you.
        <br /><br />
        We respect your privacy and do not retain your audio files. After
        real-time processing, they are deleted. If you ever want to remove
        the processed results, reach us at{' '}
        <span className="underline">support@alphy.app</span>.

  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Can I download the transcripts?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. If you are a Premium user, you can download the transcripts in subtitle (.srt) or text (.txt) format.
      </>
    )
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What are Arcs?",
    answer: (
      <>
        An Arc represents Alphy's AI-enhanced search engine for
        audiovisual content.
        <br /><br />
        Using Arcs, you can categorize and search through vast amounts of
        audio content, organized by specific subjects, creators, or
        topics. It's like music playlists, but for learning from countless
        hours of material.
